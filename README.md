# DonorProject
The aim of this project is to project and predict monthly donor flows based on various environmental and economic indicators.

The model I used first is a time series decomposition of the donor data. 

When examining the time series decomposition,  there's a noticable outlier,the year 2020. There is a sharp dip causing the trend line to be skewed.
