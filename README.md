### DonorProject

Isa Baca

#### Executive summary
The organization I work for depends on the generosity or the people in the community in which we operate. Donations are generally not mentray and instead come in the form of gently used merchandise that can be resold. The proceeds from these sales fund the free programs and services we offer the community. 
The process of procuring, sorting, and processing donations is labor and supply intensive. It requres warehouse space for storage, large boxes called gaylords for sorting and processing.   
#### Rationale
This question is important because my organizaion plays a pivotal role in reducing the ammount of waste that goes into landfills. If we are able to be strategic about the collection, distribution, and overall efficiency of donation procurement we can make an even greater impact on the community, the enviroment, and the workers responsible for maintaining the operation.


#### Research Question
When are donations flows busiest?
When do they slow down? 
Can we make a prediction based on weather foreacasts or econmic indicators?

#### Data Sources
I have donor numbers throughout the state of new mexico.
I can also pull data from the natheral weather service historical readings.
I also plan to use the consumer price index.

#### Methodology
I think time series cdecompositon will provide insight as well as linear regression.

#### Results
My initial review of the data using time sereis decomposition shows a very consistent pattern of highs and lows at particular times of the year. 

#### Next steps
I need to add more data. The sites I was initally using don't export ino formats Im familiar with or know how to manipulate effectivey.
