1. Business Understanding
The primary objective is to analyze donor behavior and predict the number of donors to improve predictions surrounding donor behaviors.
This involves:
Understanding the key drivers behind donor numbers over time.
Exploring how external factors (e.g., temperature, consumer price index) influence donations.
Developing predictive models to anticipate future donor behavior.

2. Data Understanding
The donor dataset is the foundation of the analysis, containing features such as:

Time-series data: Donation trends over time.
External factors: Average temperature, consumer price index, and other relevant variables.
Target variable: Adjusted number of donors or donation amounts. Key insights from the exploration:
Time series decomposition reveals seasonal and trend patterns in donor data.
Scatterplots and feature importance analysis highlight relationships between features like temperature and donation numbers.

3. Data Preparation
Data preprocessing steps included:

Scaling features to standardize values for modeling.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Handling missing or irrelevant data through imputation or feature selection.
Visualizing trends and distributions to ensure data quality and identify patterns.
4. Modeling
First Notebook: Donors - Time Series Decomposition
Time series decomposition was performed to break down donation trends into components (e.g., trend, seasonality, residuals).
Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between various scaled features and donor numbers.
Second Notebook: Permutation Importance and K-Nearest Neighbors
Permutation Importance: Identified the most influential features affecting donor numbers.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Decision boundaries were created to classify donors based on key features (e.g., temperature, consumer price index).
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and GridSearchCV were applied to fine-tune model parameters.
Third Notebook: Donor Neural Network Model
A neural network regression model was developed to predict donor numbers.
By leveraging multiple features, the model aimed to enhance predictive accuracy and provide deeper insights into donor behavior.

5. Evaluation
Time Series Decomposition: Visuals confirmed clear seasonal trends and highlighted fluctuations in donor numbers over time.
KNN and SVM Models: GridSearchCV improved hyperparameters, while permutation importance provided clarity on feature relevance.
Neural Network Model: Achieved improved accuracy compared to linear regression and KNN, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for complex donor prediction tasks.

6. Deployment
While not explicitly mentioned in the notebooks:

Insights can be shared with stakeholders for actionable decisions (e.g., targeted campaigns based on temperature or economic conditions).
Predictive models can be integrated into operational systems to forecast donor numbers and optimize fundraising efforts.
Summary
By following the CRISP-DM framework, the three notebooks collectively analyze donor data, identify key influencing factors, and build predictive models. These insights and models can guide data-driven strategies to improve donor experiences and predict fluctuations in the donation stream.
